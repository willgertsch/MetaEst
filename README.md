# MetaEst
A Julia package for parameter estimation of statistical models using metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The code currently supports several variations on mixture models. Examples include 1-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, 1-dimensional mixtures for flood frequency analysis, and logistic-normal models for subgroup analysis. I plan on using this code-base for several parts of my thesis focused on parameter estimation and automatic tuning of algorithms.

The second part of this [presentation](https://github.com/willgertsch/MetaEst/blob/master/documents/metaheuristics_presentation.pdf
) gives a simple example of subgroup analysis using my code. A article-style write-up can be found [here](https://github.com/willgertsch/MetaEst/blob/master/documents/Metaheuristics_for_Subgroup_Analysis.pdf).
